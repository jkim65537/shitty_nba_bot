# shitty_nba_bot

# Introduction
reddit bot that has answers for (very small number of) your NBA related questions. You won't be able to use this bot because I changed the credentials in the config file.
Only works in Python 3.

## Example Usage

### Start the bot run

```python
from nba_bot import nba_stat_bot
bot = nba_stat_bot()
bot.run()

```
